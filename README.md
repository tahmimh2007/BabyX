# Project Description:

At a school like Stuyvesant, it’s fair to say academic rigor is at the forefront of our expectations. Exams and quizzes take up a big proportion of one’s time. One thing we’ve all learned is that the key to studying is studying with quantity rather than quality. Oftentimes, we are forced to cram studying in a short time due to accumulation of other things. Our goal is to fix this issue. We want to provide a centralized location for students to find resources. They can do anything study-related on this site, from finding study guides for the most challenging courses (physics, chemistry, calc, etc.), a free-to-use whiteboard for students to write work out, and practice quizzes with data visualization features.
